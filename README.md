# Welcome to My Demo Website

This website documents my journey in learning PHP, MySQL, and Laravel from scratch. You'll find frequent updates as I navigate through this learning process.

## Requirements

To utilize this code, follow these steps:

### 1. Set up Environment Variables

- Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.
- Configure the necessary SQL connection details in the `.env` file. I use this file to store configuration variables like database credentials. This practice allows me to push everything to my repository while keeping sensitive information secure.

Install the following dependency:

```bash
composer require vlucas/phpdotenv
```
